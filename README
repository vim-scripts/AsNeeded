  [AsNeeded V14 AND LATER REQUIRES VIMBALL V18 OR LATER FOR UNPACKING]

The AsNeeded plugin loads plugins from the .vim/AsNeeded directory only as they're needed.  One major advantage over vim 7.0's autoload method is: plugins don't need to be changed!   Just put the plugin in the AsNeeded directory (usually under .vim/ or vimfiles\).  It'll work even better if you type :MkAsNeeded while in vim after having updated your AsNeeded directory, too.

So, how does it work?  Well, whenever a plugin attempts to execute a function that hasn't been loaded yet, AsNeeded will find the script in the AsNeeded directory, load the script, and execute the function.

And, whenever you want to execute a command that's not been loaded yet, and you've run :MkAsNeeded, then the plugin will be transparently loaded and the command executed!  If you didn't do :MkAsNeeded, or you wish to use a map, then instead you can use

	:AN map
	:AN command [arguments]

and AsNeeded will locate the map or command, load the script, and make the map or command available for your subsequent use.  Alternatively, you can use

	:ANX map
	:ANX command [arguments]

and AsNeeded will do what :AN would do plus attempt to execute the map or command.

For even faster loading of your desired function, map, or command, you can (as of v6) use

	:MkAsNeeded

This command will create a <ANtags> file in your AsNeeded subdirectory which basically lists your maps, functions, and commands and couples them with their associated source file.  When you then use :AN, :AsNeeded, or :ANX, AsNeeded will use that file to quickly load the associated source file.

And, now for a user testimonal!

    I use FuncUndefined sometimes but most of the
    time I use the AsNeeded mechanism of Dr.Chips,
    which is very clever, very complete and completely
    unintrusive, there is almost nothing to do once
    the mechanics is setup.  It even finds functions
    (mappings as well!!) inside a file of a different
    name, etc...  Very pleasant.
